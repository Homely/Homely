This is the home page / project overview for Homely.com.au open source projects.

At Homely, most of our development is done in private (with private repositories) but we do encourage to try and see if some of the code we do in our day-to-day work (which is used in our private systems) can be abstracted enough into a public project, for others to take advantage of.

We hope that other developers like yourself might find some of our efforts useful and/or enspiring!
